# audiobook-using-python

**Introduction**

An audio reading of the text is convenient and doesnt require as much concentration as reading requires. In this project, I implemented a simple PDF to audio converter. This code scans page(s) of PDF and reads it using audio, to the user.

**Project Flow**

1.pip install **PyPDF2**: A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of extracting document information splitting documents page by page merging documents page by page cropping pages merging multiple pages into a single page encrypting and decrypting PDF files and more!

2.pip install **pyttsx3**: pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
